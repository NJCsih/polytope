My Nixos config, I'm *very* new, and like my nvim, will probably keep it pretty simple to start with.

The majority of my config, it's structure and many of the options, are ~~stolen from~~ based off:
https://github.com/DarkKronicle/nazarick

Todo:
- (-) firefox
-- Still issues setting custom options. Sets user.js file correctly (simlinks in profile), but firefox doesnt load it
- ( ) nvim
-- I need to port to nix, currently just threw my config into ~/.config/nvim
- ( ) git oauth helper
- ( ) hardware config -- apparnetly there's a repo for a bunch of different laptops I can steal from
- ( ) gpu: drivers and config, maybe make a powersave profile
